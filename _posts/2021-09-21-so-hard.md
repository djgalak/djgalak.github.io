title: so hard to express feelings
---

I feel it is so hard to express how we feel. On the moment we can touch the feelingns, but as soon as we want to materialize them into words they start to vanish and transform. They loose their essence, their true meaning and become fake, as if transform to not be seen; as if transformed to fondre dans une mi√®vrerie.
