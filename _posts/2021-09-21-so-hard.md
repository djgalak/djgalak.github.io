title: So hard to express feelings
---

I feel it is so hard to express how we feel. On the moment we can touch the feelingns, but as soon as we want to materialize them into words they start to vanish and transform. They loose their essence, their true meaning and become fake, as if transform to not be seen; as if transformed to fondre dans une mi√®vrerie.

Of the many things I try, which ine is really me; which ine I am really made for? Which one can I master to make something of myself? After all, is anything worse it? Is it just not a lost of time; after some time, nothing will stay, nothing will be meaningfull. what is the purpose of doing all that we do?
