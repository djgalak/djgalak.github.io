Fifty. Fifty years old. Fourty one so far, but that just mean fifty is around the corner. It is going to be there very fast. Just like Fourty was here right after thirty; never seen the years go by.
And what have I done so far? kids, wife, house... okay, good; but what does all that mean? not much accomplished, right?
